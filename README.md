# Final Course Project - Image Compression 
### Course: DSC 210: Numerical Linear Algebra for Data Science
### Instructor: Dr. Tsui-wei Weng

## Requirements
Make sure all these libraries installed in the python3 environment:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- opencv-python
- Pillow
- streamlit
- streamlit-option-menu

## Starting the service
The code can be run from the python notebook as well as the python file. Both perform the same experiment, only difference being visualizations.
Streamlit has been used with the python file to visualize the levels of compression and how they affect the image.

***What is Streamlit?***

Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language that helps us to create web apps. Refer https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/create-an-app for more.

### From Jupyter notebook
Open the notebook *SVD and DCT.ipynb* and run all the cells in order.

### From python file
Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

        > streamlit run file_name.py


Sever will start on localhost.
